Consider the Beats by Dre headphones product.

They are VERY inexpensive to build and produce “good” sound with acceptable durability using cheap parts. With a premium brand positioning they make A LOT of profit (gross margin) per unit and were acquired by Apple for one billion dollars making Dr. Dre rap’s first billionaire entrepreneur.

Choose another product with similar economics (low cost to manufacture, ability to premium brand) and imagine what kind of a brand would allow for the firm to capture premium pricing. Describe the brand you envision. How much more, above current market prices, do you think you could charge? How do you know?  Compose a response in about one page.

Here's an example: Olive oil. Olive oils range from a bottle you can buy in the grocery store for a few bucks to bottles costing hundreds of dollars. The difference, other than specific attributes like purity or flavor, is brand.

So, to capture a brand premium, I might create a brand called "Mama's Secret," and feature the image of an older Italian lady smiling over a simmering pot of something magical. The brand may have attributes like being locally grown in Italy, specially prepared, unique herbs and spices, etc that make it distinct from grocery store offerings. I might then look at how premium oils are priced and think about where my new brand might fit into the marketplace.

This is perhaps the most complex application question we have had so far, as it combines positioning, brand, product and pricing. Do your best, and remember to submit on time so you can have a second try if you want/need it.
